# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
# Events: thinking of doing something blood borne related events, or justs eldritch horror related events 
#  - Amygdala location at the Cathedral ward to witness the Hunter's Nightmare  
#  - Miclosh, host of the Nightmare 
#  - Rom, at Moonside Lake 
#  - Kos at Fishing Hamlet 
#  - Ludwig at the Nightmare Church (originally at the Healing Church and lead hunters)
# Don't have to do any reviews, but can add them if I want, will just have to create a rule that a review cannot be left if the event date is later than when the review is being left I guess 
# Tickets will be a bit easier since they do not have any components to them 
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
